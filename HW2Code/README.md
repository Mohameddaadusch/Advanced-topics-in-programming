Explanation of the Input File
The input file for your vacuum cleaner simulation contains critical information about the house layout, the vacuum cleaner's docking station, battery capacity, and maximum allowed steps. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the input file:
1.	House Name/Description:
    -	Format: A string.
    -	Description: This line provides a description or name of the house. It is internal for the file and can be ignored by the          simulation.
2.	Maximum Steps Allowed:
    -	Format: MaxSteps = <NUM>.
    -	Description: Specifies the maximum number of steps the vacuum cleaner is allowed to take during the simulation. The format may or may not have spaces around the = sign.
    -	Example: MaxSteps = 1000 indicates that the vacuum cleaner can take up to 1000 steps in the simulation.
3.	Maximum Battery Steps:
    -	Format: MaxBattery = <NUM>
    -	Description: Specifies the maximum number of steps the vacuum cleaner can take before its battery is exhausted. The format may or may not have spaces around the = sign. 
    -	Example: MaxBattery = 100 indicates that the vacuum cleaner has 100 steps worth of battery life.
4.  Number of Rows:

    - Format: Rows = <NUM>
    - Description: Specifies the number of rows in the house matrix. The format may or may not have spaces around the = sign.
    - Example: Rows = 4 indicates that the house matrix has 4 rows.
5.Number of Columns:
    - Format: Cols = <NUM>
    - Description: Specifies the number of columns in the house matrix. The format may or may not have spaces around the = sign.
    - Example: Cols = 10 indicates that the house matrix has 10 columns.
6. House Matrix:

    - Format: A matrix of characters.
    - Description: Describes the layout of the house as a matrix. Each element in the matrix can have one of the following values:
        * (space): Indicates an empty space or corridor.
        * W: Indicates a wall where the vacuum cleaner cannot pass through.
        * 0-9: Indicates the amount of dirt present at that location. Higher values represent more dirt.
        * D: Indicates the docking station. There should be one and only one docking station.

Notes:
    If the file is invalid, the program should reject it and print the reason to the screen.
    The actual size of the house is determined by the values in lines 4 and 5. If there are missing lines, they should be filled in with empty lines. If there are missing columns, they should be filled in with spaces. The simulation assumes that the house is surrounded by walls on the boundaries beyond the provided rows and columns.
    If the file contains additional rows and/or columns beyond the required number, the program should ignore the redundant lines/columns.


*	Example:
1-Small house
MaxSteps = 100
MaxBattery=20
Rows = 4
Cols =10
WWWWWWWWWW
W        W
W   D    W
W 1234567W

In this example:

- The house has a description "1-Small house".
- The maximum number of steps allowed is 100.
- The maximum battery steps are 20.
- The house matrix has 4 rows and 10 columns.
- W indicates walls.
- D indicates the docking station.
- 1-7 indicates dirt levels.


Explanation of the Output format:

The output file generated by the program contains detailed information about the vacuum cleaner's operation during the simulation. The format is structured as follows:

1. NumSteps = <NUMBER>: Indicates the total count of movements the vacuum cleaner made during the simulation.

2. DirtLeft = <NUMBER>: Shows the remaining dirt level in the house after the vacuum cleaner has completed its run.

3. Status = <FINISHED/WORKING/DEAD>: Indicates whether the vacuum cleaner's mission is finished, still working, or dead (battery exhausted).

4. Steps:: Lists the steps performed by the vacuum cleaner as characters in one line with no spaces. The characters represent the   directions:
    - N for North
    - E for East
    - S for South
    - W for West
    - s for Stay
    - F for Finished (only if the algorithm actually returned “Finished”)

    for example:
        Steps:
    NESWsF

Algorithm:

The algorithm is deterministic, choosing the next step according to the Least Recently Used (LRU) principle. It selects the direction that has been chosen the least number of times. If there is a tie in this data structure, the algorithm chooses a step according to a predetermined order.

To implement this, a map is used to keep track of the number of times each direction is chosen. The vacuum cleaner continues cleaning as long as the battery level is greater than the number of blocks visited. For example, if the vacuum has visited 10 blocks, it will only continue cleaning if the battery level is more than 10; otherwise, it returns to the docking station to recharge fully, using the steps saved in the stack (the stack contains all the directions without stay, indicating the vacuum moved from one block to another).

Running the Program:
there is 2 ways:
  a.  in line 29 Iin the MAKEFILE write the "input_FileName.txt" name that you want to run, and then:
      1. write "make"
      2. write "make run"
      you will see an output file with the format: "out_inout_FileName.txt"
  
  b. 
    1. write : g++ -o myrobot Algorithm.cpp Direction.cpp House.cpp Simulator.cpp Vacuum.cpp
    2. write : ./myrobot input_FileName.txt   
    you will see an output file with the format: "out_inout_FileName.txt"
